### Summary  -  I was not able to finish my front, or back end for this assignmnet, and the game does not function. The Front end is mostly finished, however the back end portion really had me struggling from the beggining. Given More time, and I really believe this assignment could have turned out exactly as I had envisioned it

I think the design is really cool, I love how the click to start flashes like an arcade game. I like the retro theming. I believe that if you had more time you could really flesh this out, its a really cool designed. Good job!
